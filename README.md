### WHAT IS A BILL SPLITTER?

Suppose you are going on a vacation with your friends and you guys needs to share the cost of a particular bill, Your application should ensures that anyone who pays is reimbursed the correct amount.

### WHAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD?

**Develop a mobile or web or desktop application using any technology that fulfills the required functionality:**

-   The app should have a sign-in and sign-up feature
-   The app should allow users to create groups and add members to them
-   Form for adding the amount paid and selecting the member to split that transaction with
-   A record of who owes whom how much money
-   A logged-in user will have a separate screen that shows how much he or she has to pay and how much other group members have to pay them
-   The total expense of the group so that the user knows how much the trip cost

**Real world use case of the application:**

-   There is a bill for INR 5000
-   Your group consists of 10 people on vacation
-   The person paying has to be able to enter an amount and select members of the group who are involved in the purchase.
-   Afterwards, the app should divide the bill equally and keep a record of that split bill (in the above case, it's INR 500 per person).
-   A users can see how much they owe to whom and how much money other people owe them.
-   After they have paid the money to one member of the group, they should be able to settle the amount. i.e. they can mark that transaction as paid.
-   Having inbuilt payment options such as UPI/Paytm/Gpay/PhonePay whould be a plus.
